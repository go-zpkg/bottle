// Extract unpacks every entry of tr into dest, stripping strip leading path
// components from each entry name (strip == 0 keeps the archive layout). It is
// the shared archive extractor for this ecosystem — both this package's
// installer and zpkb's source fetcher route through it, so a single
// implementation carries the invariants both rely on:
//
//   - Regular files keep the modification time the archive recorded (tar(1)
//     semantics). Recipes DEPEND on this: a release tarball ships generated
//     files NEWER than the sources they derive from so make leaves them alone;
//     stamping every file "now" re-orders them by archive position and make then
//     tries to regenerate — libexpat 2.8.3 dies that way (doc/xmlwf.1 is archived
//     before, hence would be stamped older than, doc/xmlwf.xml → make runs the
//     docbook rule with no docbook2x-man installed → Error 1). A zero recorded
//     time is left as written.
//   - Absolute names, and names that escape dest after stripping, are rejected
//     with ErrInsecurePath; a hard-link source is vetted the same way.
//   - An entry whose path crosses a symlink an EARLIER entry created is
//     rejected with ErrInsecurePath. A name check is lexical and a write is
//     not: `dest/a/b` is inside dest even when `a` is a link out of it.
//   - setuid, setgid and sticky are dropped: an entry gets its permission bits
//     and nothing else.
//   - Directories, regular files, symlinks and hard links are reproduced;
//     unsupported entry types (fifos, devices, ...) are skipped.
//   - A hard link whose link(2) is REFUSED becomes a copy, with the source's
//     permissions. Android denies link(2) on /data while allowing symlink(2),
//     and gnu.org/glibc hard-links its getconf variants, so one refused syscall
//     made the implicit libc closure unreachable there. Two names for one inode
//     is an optimisation; "these paths hold the same content" is the claim, and
//     a copy makes it at the cost of disk. Both errors are reported if the copy
//     fails too.
//
// What it does NOT promise: a symlink ENTRY may point anywhere, including out
// of dest, which is what tar(1) does and what an artifact's relative links need.
// Nothing Extract writes afterwards follows such a link — that is the
// ErrInsecurePath rule above — but a caller that walks the result and resolves
// symlinks itself can still leave dest, and must say whether it means to.
